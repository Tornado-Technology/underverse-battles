Ink is soulless, thus locking himself from feeling things on his own. That's where his paint flasks come in handy, endowing him with emotions when consumed over time. Thanks to that, he commonly appears as a cheerful and playful being, always ready to help. Ink wields a brush as a primary weapon, which he calls Broomie. He's able to form different attacks by using his ink.",
